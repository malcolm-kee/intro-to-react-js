# Introduction to React JS

A complete introduction to React - up and running with React by learning tooling that improves your development workflow, React core API, and common how-to e.g. writing tests, routing, and code splitting.

> This repo outlines the content of the workshop - separate repo will be written as a code-along sample for the workshop.

## Prerequisite

This workshop assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go.
- you have basic idea of what a source-control system is. This workshop will use git, but you won't be expected to know how to use it. Exact git command will be provided so you to copy and paste during the workshop.

## Setup

To avoid the workshop time being spent on downloading and installing tools, make sure you have the following software installed before the workshop starts:

- node.js and npm ([Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- git ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- VS code ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)) - you can use other editor if you wish, but when discussing editor integration, this workshop will focus on VS code only.
